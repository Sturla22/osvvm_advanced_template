# OSVVM Advanced Template

An advanced template for setting up OSVVM with a Test Controller.

I based this template on the tests in [OSVVM's UART verification component](https://github.com/OSVVM/UART/blob/ec0e17f6622145173754d6b56f78d86cf92cd249/testbench/TbUart_Checkers1.vhd).

## Usage

To use the template clone this repository, change 'example' to something descriptive (both the directory name and any mention of example in the files) and fill in for comments that start with 'Template:'.
